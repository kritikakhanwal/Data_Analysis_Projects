# Data_Analysis_Projects

Project 1:

\item \textbf{Biodiversity Data Analysis Project:} Implemented a comprehensive data analysis project using \textbf{pandas}, \textbf{seaborn}, and \textbf{matplotlib}. Cleaned and processed data from two CSV files, namely observations.csv and species_info.csv, addressing missing values and ensuring data quality. The entire analysis, including code details and comments, is documented in the Jupyter Notebook: \href{link/to/biodiversity.ipynb}{\textcolor{blue}{biodiversity.ipynb}}.
